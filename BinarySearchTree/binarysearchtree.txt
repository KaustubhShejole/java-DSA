Left Subtree Nodes < Root
Right Subtree Nodes > Root
Left and Right Subtrees are also BST with no duplicates

Assumptions: Binary Search Tree is without duplicates.
inorder traversal : we get a sorted sequence in ascending order

Binary Search Tree makes search efficient. Worst case in case of skew tree.
        O(H) whereH is the height of the tree.

Most problems will be solved using recursion i.e. by dividing into
subproblems and making recursive calls on subtrees.
