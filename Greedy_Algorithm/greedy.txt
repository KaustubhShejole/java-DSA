Most of the Greedy Algorithms
    1. Optimization
    2. Sorting
    3. fixed rule not present
    4. Not realized

Definition of Greedy Algorithm:
    Greedy algorithms is the problem solving technique
    where we make the locally optimum choice at each
    stage and hope to achieve a global optimum.

Pros: Simple and Easy
    Good enough Time Complexity
Cons: A lot of time global, optimum not achieved.
