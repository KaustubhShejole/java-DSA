String str1 = "abc";
String str2 = "abc;
String str3 = new String("abc");

Interning

both str1 and str2 which are reference variables point to the same value string "abc"

for str3 new String would be made ,so str3 would point to different string "abc"

String str = "abc";
for(char c = 'a' to 'z'){
    str+=ch;
}//run 26*n times

copying is done at each stage
abc
abca
abcab
...
abcab...z

m*n: m:length of string and n is the number of characters to add.
if both are big then we will have quadratic time complexity.

So it will be very inefficient.
So here we will not use STrings we will use StringBuilder.
